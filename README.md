Exercise 2:

Create a small web application with a Bootstrap theme.
You may choose any Front-end technology, but the backend must be written in C#.
Display a flight list:
A single flight consists of a name, a departure airport, and an arrival airport.
The list should also display the computed distance between the two airports (each airport has some GPS coordinates).
The user can add, delete, or modify a flight from the list.
The developer will be evaluated on the architecture of the application (not a single project, but separate CSPROJ projects in the VS solution).
Proper code (injection, interface, design patterns, etc.) and unit tests are expected.
No constraints are imposed on the storage (it can be a SQL Database, a flat file, etc.), the developer can decide freely.
As the airport list does not need to be input by the user, it can be stored or injected directly in the backend storage chosen by the developer.
 

The candidate must read the constraints carefully and must deliver something akin to a real professional context.
The candidate must provide their work on GitHub with a public
